# Computer_Vision_Classification
he agriculture industry is very labor intensive with a lot of work being done manually to check if plants are growing and identifying and removing weeds. This trillion-dollar industry is ripe for transformation as artificial intelligence can aid in the identification and classificaion of various plants, thus freeing up a magnitude of capacity for human works.

This project aims to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the plant seedlings into 12 categories.
